# Matt-Nemmer.github.io

This repository contains Matt Nemmer's personal website, which is currently being hosted on Github Pages. 

Development has been ongoing for many years, and several versions have been published:
- v1: Simple, old-fashioned looking site.
- v2: Much more marketing oriented, with a modernized layout and various animations. Features updated content and major improvements in terms of user experience. Relies on Bootstrap for styling.
- v3: Work in-progress. Will be a simplified version with fewer pages to start, but more content on each. Maybe even a single-page application, or I could use Node.js/Eleventy to generate static files. Will probably include a blog this time. Not sure yet.

The site makes use of cookies for storing user settings and the Bootstrap framework for styling.
