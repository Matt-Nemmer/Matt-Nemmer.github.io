# Matt-Nemmer.github.io

This repository contains Matt Nemmer's personal website, which is currently being hosted on Github Pages. 

Development has been ongoing for many years, and several versions have been published:
- v1: Simple, old-fashioned looking site.
- v2: Much more marketing oriented, with a modernized layout and various animations. Features updated content and major improvements in terms of user experience. Relies on Bootstrap for styling.
- v3: A simplified v2, implemented as a single-page application. Relies on a basic front-end JavaScript templating system to add sections to the page. Site settings now automatically apply upon making changes.

The site uses cookies for storing settings and the Bootstrap framework for styling.
