            <h3>Movterra</h3>
            <p>Additional information coming soon.</p>
            
            <h3>Biomapper</h3>
            <p>Biomapper is a mobile application that allows ecologists to view forest data they need 
on color-coded maps. As part of my undergraduate capstone project, I had the role of team lead and ensured that the 
project was a major success.</p>
            
            <h3>Land Vehicle Simulator</h3>
            <p>This online simulator can be used to aid in the designing of land-based vehicles. It primarily features tools for 
four-wheeled vehicles. I previously designed the app using Java. However, I created a web-app version because I wanted it to be 
more accessible to the public.</p>
            
            <h3><a>STICH Scholar</a></h3>
            <p>I worked as the robotics and drone specialist for Northern Arizona University's Center for Science, Teaching, and Learning's 
STEM Interaction and Communications Hub (STICH). As such, I created educational materials and supported robotics programs involving 
youth and underprivileged communities. More specifically, I created educational materials about Arduino microcontrollers, recruited and surveyed 
FIRST robotics competition volunteers and team coaches, as well as creating a product list and curriculum for young students living in rural areas and 
on Native American reservations.</p>
            
            <h3>This Website!</h3>
            <p>I have been improving my web development skills for nearly a decade. I intend to 
improve this website greatly while showcasing my ability to implement PHP scripts and an SQL database.</p>
